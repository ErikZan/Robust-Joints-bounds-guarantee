# Robust satisfaction of joint position and velocity bounds for robot manipulators
Deals with the problem of controlling a robot which joints have position and velocity bounds and bounded accelerations.
### Robust viability with joint acceleration limits (RJBG)
Deals with robust control of robotic system controlled in acceleration and subject to bounded disturbances on the input
### Viability with joint torque limits (Bravo_like_algorithm)
Deals with the viability problem for a torque-controlled robotic system (at present time the single pendulum)
